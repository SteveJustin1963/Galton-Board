Looking at the provided C code, your Forth program mostly translates the functionality 
of the C code correctly, but some adjustments are necessary to handle memory allocation and initialisation:

1. The bins are not initialised to zero in the Forth code. This can be accomplished with a loop.
2. The random number function in Forth may work differently from C's `rand() % 2`. 
    You need to make sure that the `rand` word generates a uniformly distributed random number either 0 or 1.

Here's a version of the Forth code which incorporates these changes:

```forth
10 CONSTANT PEGS
11 CONSTANT BINS

CREATE bins BINS CELLS ALLOT

100 CONSTANT numBalls

: srand  ( -- )  GET-TIME  SEED RANDOM ;
: rand  ( -- n )  RANDOM  2 MOD ;

: init-bins ( -- )
    BINS 0 DO
        0 I bins CELLS + !
    LOOP ;

: adjust-position  ( n -- n' )  DUP  0< IF  DROP 0 ELSE  DUP BINS >= IF  DROP BINS 1- ELSE  THEN THEN ;

: simulate-balls  ( -- )
    numBalls 0 DO
        0 ( starting position )
        PEGS 0 DO
            rand IF 1+ ELSE 1- THEN ( move left or right )
        LOOP
        adjust-position
        bins SWAP CELLS + @ 1+ SWAP bins SWAP CELLS + ! ( increment the corresponding bin )
    LOOP ;

: print-bins  ( -- )
    ." Bins:" CR
    BINS 0 DO
        I 2 .R ." : " 
        bins I CELLS + @ .
        CR
    LOOP ;

: main  ( -- )
    srand
    init-bins
    simulate-balls
    print-bins ;

main
```

The `init-bins` word initialises the bins to 0. In `simulate-balls`, the bin corresponding 
to the final position of the ball is incremented by first fetching the current count
(`bins SWAP CELLS + @`), incrementing it (`1+`), and then storing it back in the same 
bin (`SWAP bins SWAP CELLS + !`). This sequence is necessary because Forth doesn't have a `+!` 
operation that works directly on cell-based arrays. 
The `print-bins` word has been adjusted to match the output format of the C program.

This version of the Forth program should behave more similarly to the C code. 
Again, it assumes that your Forth system has the words GET-TIME, SEED RANDOM, RANDOM, 
CREATE, ALLOT, CELLS, +!, @, ., .R, CR, and that they behave as expected. 
These are not part of the ANSI Forth standard, but are common in many Forth systems. 
If some of these words are not available or behave differently, further adjustments may be necessary.
